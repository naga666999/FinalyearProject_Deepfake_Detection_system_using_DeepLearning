# DeepFake Detection System for Face-Swap Videos Using Deep Learning

This project aims to detect deepfake media‚Äîparticularly face-swapped videos‚Äîusing advanced deep learning models. We use GRUs for temporal video analysis and CNN-based architectures (VGG16 and MobileNet) for image analysis. A web-based user interface allows users to upload media and receive real-time authenticity verification.
